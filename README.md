# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

In this odd-numbered week, I embarked on the challenge of starting a project from scratch, devoid of any startup code. My task involved creating a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API, marking my inaugural experience in working with an API. Despite being unfamiliar with this terrain, I navigated through numerous challenges and difficulties, ultimately succeeding in my endeavor.

The initial version of the website guides users to input their desired city name for weather information. Upon clicking the search button, users are presented with current and future weather details for the specified city. The website dynamically adjusts to display information relevant to the user's searched location on the globe. Moreover, I implemented a feature to store the user's searched city in local storage, subsequently appending the saved data into buttons. These buttons serve as a convenient means for users to revisit their previous searches with a simple click.
